I am a 3rd-year physics PhD candidate at Princeton University. My advisors are William Bialek (Princeton) and David Schwab (CUNY).

My research interests are in the application of techniques and ideas from physics and complex systems to artificial neural networks in order to understand how they learn and abstract.

My current research in machine learning/AI includes projects in ***mechanistic interpretability, meta-learning, in-context learning, and LLM multi-agent interactions***.

You can reach me by email at lindsay.smith@princeton (dot) edu.

Previously, I was an undergrad at the University of Pennsylvania where I majored in physics (with honors), minored in mathematics and French and Francophone studies, and graduated cum laude. My undergrad research advisor was Dani Bassett, and I researched human white matter brain networks, the human perception of the stars in the night sky, and abstraction in reservoir computers (a type of RNN).

Before undergrad, I worked on a project at WSU designing a flux spectrometer for the DUNE collaboration at Fermilab, advised by Holger Meyer.
