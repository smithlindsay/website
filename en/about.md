I am a 4th-year physics PhD candidate and NSF GRFP fellow at Princeton University. My advisors are William Bialek (Princeton) and David Schwab (CUNY). My research focus is studying the **science of AI**, drawing on my background in physics and complex systems.

My current research in machine learning/AI includes projects in ***mechanistic interpretability, in-context learning, and LLM multi-agent interactions***.

I'm also investigating chain-of-thought injections as a control method for AI safety in the [MARS 3.0 research program](https://www.cambridgeaisafety.org/mars). More information on our project can be found on the [Geodesic Research website](https://www.geodesicresearch.org/research).

I'm happy to chat via email at lindsay.smith@princeton (dot) edu.

## Background

Previously, I was an undergrad at the University of Pennsylvania where I majored in physics (with honors), minored in mathematics and French and Francophone studies, and graduated cum laude. My undergrad research advisor was Dani Bassett, and I researched human white matter brain networks, the human perception of the stars in the night sky, and abstraction in reservoir computers (a type of RNN).


Before undergrad, I worked on a project at WSU designing a flux spectrometer for the [DUNE](https://lbnf-dune.fnal.gov/) collaboration at Fermilab, advised by Holger Meyer.
